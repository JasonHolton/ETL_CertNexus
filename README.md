The Jupyter notebook in this repo contains final project code for the Extract, Transform, and Load Data course by CertNexus (offered through Coursera). The scenario for this project is as follows:
You work for an online retailer that sells a wide variety of different items to consumers. Each sale through the online storefront is recorded in a database wtih various characteristics, including invoice number, product stock code, quantity purchased, sale price, description, etc. As part of your data science business project, your team has been tasked with creating models that can give the business more insights into it customers' behavior, and even predict future purchasing decisions. Before you can do that however, you need to go through the preliminary ETL process to make sure your data is in an acceptable state.
